# Burnt Clutch

Buckle up for a high-octane 3D racing web application developed using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Rapier.js](https://rapier.rs/). Development was done using TypeScript. 

This was my first time working in 3 dimensions, and it taught me a lot - I hope you enjoy!

# Instructions

The application is being hosted [here](https://burnt-clutch.vercel.app/) using the service [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The quickest/simplest way to access the game itself is through this method. Initial loading of maps can be **slow**, the free version being used is not as powerful as desired. Subsequent loads are cached and are much faster.

The application runs using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/), so to run locally...
- clone
- open terminal & navigate to root directory of project
- run the following...
	*npm install*
	*npm run dev* 


Currently, to exit a map and return to the loading screen users must refresh the page (**ctrl + R**).

# Next Issues
- Pause Menu (in progress)
- Optimize Track Complexity & Loading
